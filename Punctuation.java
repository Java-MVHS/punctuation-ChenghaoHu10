		"Administration. It was the evident wish and will of Parliament and the " +
		"nation should be conceived on the broadest possible basis and that it should " +
		"include all parties, both those who supported the late Government and also the parties " +
		"of the Opposition. " +
		"I have completed the most important part of this task. A War Cabinet has " +
		"been formed of five Members, representing, with the Liberal Opposition, the unity of the " +
		"nation. The three party Leaders have agreed to serve, either in the War Cabinet or in "+
		"high executive office. The three Fighting Services have been filled. It was necessary " +
		"that this should be done in one single day, on account of the extreme urgency and " +
		"rigour of events. A number of other key positions were filled yesterday, and I am " +
		"submitting a further list to His Majesty tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of the " +
		"principal Ministers during tomorrow. The appointment of the other Ministers usually " +
		"takes a little longer, but I trust that, when Parliament meets again, this part of my task " +
		"will be completed, and that the Administration will be complete in all respects." +
		"Sir, I considered it in the public interest to suggest that the House should " +
		"be summoned to meet today. Mr. Speaker agreed and took the necessary steps, in " +
		"accordance with the powers conferred upon him by the Resolution of the House. At the " +
		"end of the proceedings today, the Adjournment of the House will be proposed until " +
		"Tuesday, the 21st May, with, of course, provision for earlier meeting, if need be. The " +
		"business to be considered during that week will be notified to Members at the earliest " +
		"opportunity. I now invite the House, by the Resolution which stands in my name, to " +
		"record its approval of the steps taken and to declare its confidence in the  Government. " +
		"Sir, to form an Administration of this scale and complexity is a serious " +
		"undertaking in itself, but it must be remembered that we are in the preliminary stage of " +
		"one of the greatest battles in history, that we are in action at many points in Norway and " +
		"in Holland, that we have to be prepared in the Mediterranean, that the air battle is " +
		"continuous and that many preparations have to be made here at home. In this crisis I " +
		"hope I may be pardoned if I do not address the House at any length today. I hope that " +
		"any of my friends and colleagues, or former colleagues, who are affected by the political " +
		"reconstruction, will make all allowances for any lack of ceremony with which it has been " +
		"necessary to act. I would say to the House, as I said to those whoâ€™ve joined this " +
		"government: I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. " +
		"We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before " +
		"us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I " +
		"will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the " +
		"strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never " +
		"surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You " +
		"ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: victory. Victory at all costs, victory in " +
		"spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, " +
		"there is no survival. Let that be realised; no survival for the British Empire, no survival " +
		"for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge and impulse of the " +
		"ages, that mankind will move forward towards its goal. " +
		"But I take up my task with buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause " +
		"will not be suffered to fail among men. At this time I feel entitled to claim the aid of all, " +
		"and I say, Come then, let us go forward together with our united strength. ");
